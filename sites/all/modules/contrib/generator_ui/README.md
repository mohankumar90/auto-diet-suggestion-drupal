## About Generator UI
This module is for Drupal 8 developpers (from beginners to advanced ones) only. There will never be any "stable" release as it is intended to be a dev tool under constant development.
Generator UI allows you to develop faster by allowing you to generate code from template files packaged into the module within your Drupal installation. As an example you can therefore create a module with a path and its permission directly into your drupal installation. Up to you to change the default "hello world" into whatever you want.
